\documentclass[oneside,12pt]{book}
    % The option oneside is required for UNLV theses.
    % Font can be 11 or 12 point only
\usepackage{amsthm,amssymb,amsmath,latexsym,graphicx} 
	% Optional packages.
\usepackage{setspace,UNLVthesis} 
	% Required packages.  
\usepackage[round]{natbib}
	% This loads the natbib package, which is a powerful bibliography formatting system.
\bibpunct[, ]{(}{)}{;}{a}{}{,}
	% This command sets the formatting of the citations. Adjust as needed for your style.
\usepackage{url}
\urlstyle{same}
	% The URL package is used to format the URLs in the document. This way, you don't have to "escape" the characters that appear in the URL. You'll just type \url{www.myurl.com}. The second command makes sure that they appear in the same font as the rest of the document.
\usepackage{pdfpages}
\usepackage{booktabs, caption}	
	% This package formats the tables correctly.
\usepackage{rotating}
\pagestyle{unlv} 
	% This is defined in UNLVthesis.sty. 

\usepackage[english]{babel} 
% This is for the dummy text in the chapters. You won't need this.
\usepackage{blindtext}
% This is also for demonstration purposes only. You should remove all commands related to this package when you insert your own text. They all begin with \blind or \Blind.
\usepackage[capitalise, noabbrev]{cleveref}
% This package lets you use the \cref command to make cross references. Don't load packages after this one; this one needs to go in last.

\newtheorem{theorem}{Theorem}
\newtheorem{corollary}[theorem]{Corollary}  
\newtheorem{lemma}[theorem]{Lemma}
	% These define the format and numbering of theorem like environments. Corollaries and Lemmas are numbered as theorems. These may be commented out when theorems are not used.


\theoremstyle{definition}
\newtheorem{definition}{Definition}
\newtheorem*{introduction}{Introduction}
\newtheorem*{conclusion}{Conclusion}
	% This environment is not in italics, like theorems are.These define the format and numbering of definition like environments. The * means it is unnumbered. Again, these can be commented out when theorems are not used

% Put definitions here.  
\newcommand{\TitleName}{THE TITLE OF YOUR THESIS OR DISSERTATION}	
	%This is the title of your dissertation in capital letters
\newcommand{\AuthorName}{Your Legal Name}	 
	%This is your legal name to appear on the title page, copyright, etc.


\begin{document}

\pagenumbering{roman}
	% Items before Chapter 1 have roman numbers (if any).
\include{SampleTitlepage} 
	% Replace this file name with the name of your title page.
\include{SampleCopyright} 
	% A copyright statement is optional, but recommended. Rename.
    % The copyright page has no page number -- the title page is always page i and the
   % Thesis Approval page is always page ii. The Graduate College inserts this for you.
\newpage \setcounter{page}{3}

\include{SampleAbstract} 
	% This is where the abstract goes. Rename. 
\include{SampleAcknowledgements}  
	% This is optional. Rename.
\include{SampleDedication} 
	% This is also optional. Rename.
	% You could add a preface here if you want. See the formatting guide.

\renewcommand\contentsname{Table of Contents} 
	% This adjusts the way the Table of Contents label looks.
\tableofcontents 
	% This inserts table of contents. Use headings and subheadings consistently in your chapters and they will appear properly here. See the note in SampleChapter1 about how to use the square brackets as a hack to get the colon to appear between the chapter number and the chapter title. 
\listoftables \addcontentsline{toc}{schapter}{\listtablename}
	% Comment out if there are no tables. If you use an appendix, be sure to label these with the appropriate table notations. Tables in the appendices need to appear in this list.
\listoffigures \addcontentsline{toc}{schapter}{\listfigurename}
	% Comment out if there are no figures. If you use an appendix, be sure to label these with the appropriate figure notations. Figures in the appendices need to appear in this list.



\newpage 
	% This sets the page numbers properly.
	
\pagenumbering{arabic} 
	% Chapter 1 begins on page 1.

\include{SampleChapter1} 
	% Replace these with your chapters. Rename these as necessary.
\include{SampleChapter2}

\include{SampleChapter3}

\include{SampleAppendix} 
	% Optional. Duplicate if you need more than one appendix. Note the labeling requirements; if you have more than one appendix, they need to be labeled Appendix A: Title, Appendix B: Title, etc.
\include{SampleBibliography} 
	% There are some special commands in this file.
\includepdf[pagecommand={\thispagestyle{plain}}]{cv.pdf}
	% You will need to open the cv.tex file and edit the contents. Next, compile the document. That creates the pdf file that is referenced in the command above. Then, your cv will appear with page numbers in the correct spot in your document.

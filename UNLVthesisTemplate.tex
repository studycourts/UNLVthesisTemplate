% This package was originally developed by Professor Arthur   %
% Baragar. It was updated in 2016 by Professor Rebecca Gill.  %
% For more information on this revised template, contact Dr.  %
% Gill at rebecca.gill@unlv.edu. See below for revisions.     %
% The content in the sample chapters was contributed by both  %
% Baragar and Dr. Gill. Additional content explaining the     %
% current (as of June 2016) UNLV Graduate College formatting  %
% requirements is taken directly from the September 17, 2015  %
% "Organization of the Thesis and Dissertation Compiled       %
% Manuals."  This template has been revised by Kenneth Retzl  %
% and Kate Eugenis as they wrote their dissertations.         %
% Particular thanks is due to Kenneth Retzl for fixing the    %
% page numbers on landscape pages to be in line with UNLV     %
% Grad College Standards.                                     %

% 12/8/2017: Updates to footnote style, headers for sections    %
%             prior to Chapter 1, changes in the look of        %
%             sections and sub sections. Modified the location  %
%             of page numbers so as to not overlap the foot-    %
%             notes.  Finally, adding packages to put page      %
%             numbers on landscape pages on the correct edge.   %
%             Updates to sample chapters to show the table      %
%             and figure code in action. Other slight           %
%             modifications to improve looks and                %
%             functionality - too many to name here.            %
% 6/29/2016: Updates to language in the sample chapters.        %
%	     Extended discussion of how to organize the             %
%	     bibliography using natbib. Replaced original CV        %
%            page with a CV template using the article class.   %
% 6/21/2016: Overhaul of the original Baragar template to       %
%            meet UNLV Graduate College requirements as per     %

% The URL package is used to format the URLs in the document. This way, you don't have to "escape" the characters that appear in the URL. You'll just type \url{www.myurl.com}. The second command makes sure that they appear in the same font as the rest of the document.
\usepackage{pdfpages}
\usepackage{booktabs, caption}	
% This package formats the tables correctly.
\usepackage{rotating}
%\usepackage{float}
\pagestyle{unlv}

\usepackage[capitalise, noabbrev]{cleveref}
% This package lets you use the \cref command to make cross references. Don't load packages after this one; this one needs to go in last.

\theoremstyle{definition}
\newtheorem{definition}{Definition}
\newtheorem*{introduction}{Introduction}
\newtheorem*{conclusion}{Conclusion}
% This environment is not in italics, like theorems are.These define the format and numbering of definition like environments. The * means it is unnumbered. Again, these can be commented out when theorems are not used

% Put definitions here.

\tableofcontents

\listoftables \addcontentsline{toc}{schapter}{\listtablename}
	% Comment out if there are no tables. If you use an appendix, be sure to label these with the appropriate table notations. Tables in the appendices need to appear in this list.

\include{SampleBibliography} 
	% There are some special commands in this file.
\includepdf[pagecommand={\thispagestyle{plain}}]{cv.pdf}
	% You will need to open the cv.tex file and edit the contents. Next, compile the document. That creates the pdf file that is referenced in the command above. Then, your cv will appear with page numbers in the correct spot in your document.
